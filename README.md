# Mental-Health-Analysis-among-College-Students
Mental health challenges among college students are
a growing concern globally. This study investigates the intricate
relationship between various factors and mental health
outcomes among the SRM Institute of Science and Technology
students. A comprehensive questionnaire addressed emotional
well-being, stress levels, social support, health practices, and
academic pressure. Contrary to widespread assumption, the
investigation found that sleep patterns, which are frequently
regarded as crucial, did not significantly affect the indices of
mental health. Additionally, extended irregular sleep did not
result in normalization, emphasizing how intricate this
relationship is. The study's findings emphasize the multifaceted
nature of mental health, suggesting that a holistic approach
encompassing stress management, social engagement, and
emotional well-being, alongside sleep hygiene, is imperative.
This research challenges existing perceptions, encouraging a
nuanced understanding of the factors shaping mental health.
The implications extend to the design of comprehensive
interventions and support programs for college students. This
study contributes valuable insights, paving the way for more
informed, holistic, and practical strategies to nurture students'
mental health
